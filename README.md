# NFT Based Content Authenticity & Verification System
This project is a blockchain-based framework that focuses on enhancing the authenticity and credibility of content shared on social networks. Leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs), this project provides a solution for evaluating the authenticity of social media content.

## Features
- Implementing ITokens, CTokens, and VTokens for identity, content, and verification management.
- Integration with blockchain technology for decentralized and transparent operations.
- Adaptable for various social media platforms.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To test these on your own custom chain or a test-net , you need to deploy the Contracts (IToken,CToken,VToken) and replace the address and ABI (if neceesary). For that matter, you might need following softwares :
- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Hardhat
