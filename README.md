# NFT Based Content Authenticity & Verification System
This is a playground for testing the  [content authenticity verification framework](https://github.com/mohroba/nft_content_verification)

## Features
Each contract has a dedicated html and js file that forms a simple interface to interact with contracts.
- IToken Contract -> https://mohroba.github.io/nft_content_verification_playground/itoken.html
- CToken Contract -> https://mohroba.github.io/nft_content_verification_playground/ctoken.html
- VToken Contract -> https://mohroba.github.io/nft_content_verification_playground/vtoken.html

### Prerequisites
To test these on your own custom chain or a test-net , you need to deploy the Contracts (IToken,CToken,VToken) and replace the address and ABI (if neceesary). For that matter, you might need following softwares :
- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Hardhat

Also remember that playground works with any Web3 supported wallet (Metamask preferred).
